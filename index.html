                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Brea Viragh is a USA Today bestselling romance author. She's an avid traveler, sushi addict, and boho dreamer. She earned a Bachelor of Art degree at Berea College, and a dual Master of Science degree from Nova Southeastern University.
                    She has written many genres including contemporary small town, paranormal romance, paranormal and urban fantasy, and all hot enough to scorch the pages. Her heroines don’t shy away from dark, realistic situations as they navigate her elegantly crafted worlds. There may be some hard some hard lessons along the way, but Brea’s characters need not look outside themselves to find  home on their way to happily ever after.
                    Brea loves all things magical. She is proud Gryffindor, a member of the Fairy Tail Guild, and a Brakebills University for Magical Pedagogy alumna. It is her personal opinion that a rainy day is best spent curled up on the couch with a book, coffee, and pet snuggles. She currently lives in the Blue Ridge mountains of Virginia with her dog and 3 cats.</p>
